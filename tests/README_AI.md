# README_AI.md - tests

## Purpose
Test suite for the codeindex package, providing comprehensive unit tests for core components including directory tree building, code parsing, smart writing functionality, symbol importance scoring with visibility-based, semantic importance, documentation quality, complexity-based, and naming pattern (noise detection) ranking, adaptive symbols configuration, adaptive symbol selector with size-based limits, configuration loading with adaptive symbols support, SmartWriter integration with adaptive symbol selection, technical debt detection with both unit tests and BDD scenarios, symbol overload detection with massive symbol count and high noise ratio detection, super large file detection with multi-turn dialogue strategy recommendation, and shared test utilities.
