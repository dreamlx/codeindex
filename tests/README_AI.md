# README_AI.md - tests

## Purpose
Test suite for the codeindex package, providing comprehensive unit tests for core components including directory tree building, code parsing, smart writing functionality, and symbol importance scoring with visibility-based, semantic importance, documentation quality, complexity-based, and naming pattern (noise detection) ranking.

## Architecture
The test suite is organized into four main test modules that mirror the core components of the codeindex package:
- `test_directory_tree.py` validates directory structure traversal and tree building
- `test_parser.py` verifies code parsing capabilities for Python and PHP
- `test_smart_writer.py` tests intelligent README generation with different detail levels
- `test_symbol_scorer.py` validates symbol importance scoring with contextual awareness, visibility scoring, semantic importance scoring, documentation quality scoring, complexity scoring, and naming pattern scoring across languages

## Key Components
- `_create_test_structure()`: Creates temporary directory structures for testing
- `test_directory_tree_*`: Validates DirectoryTree class functionality including level determination, children management, and processing order
- `test_parse_*()`: Tests parsing of functions, classes, PHP syntax features, and error handling
- `test_smart_writer_*()`: Verifies README generation at different detail levels, file grouping, and size limits
- `TestSymbolScorerBase`: Tests symbol scorer initialization, scoring consistency, and score differentiation
- `TestVisibilityScoring`: Validates visibility-based scoring for PHP (public/protected/private) and Python (public/private/magic methods)
- `TestSemanticScoring`: Validates semantic importance scoring based on method name keywords (critical: 25.0, secondary: 15.0, generic: 5.0)
- `TestDocumentationScoring`: Validates documentation quality scoring based on docstring length (long >200 chars: 15.0, medium >50 chars: 10.0, short: 5.0, none: 0.0)
- `TestComplexityScoring`: Validates complexity scoring based on method line count (>100 lines: 20.0, 50-100 lines: 15.0, 20-50 lines: 10.0, <20 lines: 5.0)
- `TestNamingPatternScoring`: Validates naming pattern scoring (noise detection) with penalties for getter/setter methods (-10.0), is/has methods (-10.0), private methods (-15.0), and magic methods (-20.0)
- `_create_mock_parse_result()`: Helper for creating mock parsing results
