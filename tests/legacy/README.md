# Legacy Tests

**Status**: Historical tests from early development (moved 2026-02-07)

These tests were moved from the root directory during project cleanup.
They may be outdated or superseded by tests in the main `tests/` directory.

## Files

- `test_adaptive_debug.py` - Early adaptive symbol extraction debugging
- `test_current_project.py` - Project-specific testing
- `test_hierarchical*.py` - Hierarchical indexing experiments
- `test_operategoods.py` - Unknown purpose (requires review)
- `test_hierarchical_test/` - Test directory for hierarchical features

## Action Required

These tests should be reviewed and either:
1. **Integrated** into the main test suite if still relevant
2. **Updated** if functionality is still used but tests are outdated
3. **Deleted** if obsolete

## History

Moved from root directory as part of Phase 1 cleanup to improve project organization.
