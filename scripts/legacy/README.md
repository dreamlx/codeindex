# Legacy Scripts

**Status**: Experimental code from early development (moved 2026-02-07)

These files were moved from the root directory during project cleanup.

## Files

- `hierarchical_strategy.py` - Early hierarchical indexing strategy experiments
- `PROJECT_INDEX.json` - Sample project index output (may be outdated)

## Purpose

This directory serves as an archive for experimental code that:
1. May contain useful ideas for future features
2. Shouldn't clutter the root directory
3. Isn't currently part of the main codebase

## Action

Review these files periodically:
- Delete if no longer relevant
- Extract useful patterns into main codebase
- Update documentation if functionality was adopted

## History

Moved from root directory as part of Phase 1 cleanup.
