(2) The CLI command reference is truncated mid-sentence ('loomgr') \u2014 the 'Step 3: inject into LightRAG' command is incomplete. (3) No dependency installation instructions specific to LoomGraph (only mentions `uv pip install -e \".[dev]\"` but doesn't clarify if codeindex/LightRAG need to be installed locally as dependencies). (4) The 'Project Structure' section shows planned directories but doesn't indicate which ones actually exist vs. are aspirational. (5) Missing: how to run the MCP server locally, what the current development status is (MVP? alpha? which features are implemented?), and how the three repos coordinate during development (e.g., do you need all three running locally?). (6) The H200 server IPs/ports are hardcoded \u2014 no guidance on what to do if the server is down or how to use a local fallback. (7) The codeindex section at the top references a `.codeindex.yaml` that may not exist yet in this project.",

This means the scan-all --fallback step produced a skeleton overview without extracting any meaningful code structure. The flow breaks down between steps 2 and 3: scan-all completes but yields no actionable information (no symbols, no file listings, no architectural context), so 'status' confirming coverage is misleading \u2014 coverage exists but is vacuous. Without symbols, file descriptions, or component relationships, a developer cannot identify which module to modify for any feature. The root cause is likely that LoomGraph's src/ structure doesn't match codeindex's supported language parsers, or the include/exclude patterns in .codeindex.yaml filter out all source files. The logical next step \u2014 using the README_AI.md to navigate code \u2014 is completely blocked because the document contains no navigable content.",

An AI agent receiving these instructions would likely either apply codeindex conventions incorrectly to LoomGraph, or stall due to inability to resolve the gap between documented architecture and actual project state.",
