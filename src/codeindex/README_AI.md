# README_AI.md - codeindex

## Purpose
AI-native code indexing tool that automatically generates README_AI.md files for directories using external LLM CLI tools. Includes technical debt detection capabilities for code quality analysis with multiple output formats.

## Architecture
The tool follows a pipeline architecture where directories are scanned, parsed, formatted into prompts, and sent to external AI CLI tools for documentation generation. It supports incremental updates, parallel processing, hierarchical organization with two-phase AI enhancement, intelligent symbol scoring for prioritization, adaptive symbol extraction with dynamic limit calculation, and technical debt detection with flexible output formatting for code quality assessment.

Data Flow:
```
Directory (Scanner) → Files (Scanner) → Parsed Data (Parser) → 
Symbol Scoring (SymbolImportanceScorer) → Adaptive Symbol Selection (AdaptiveSymbolSelector) → 
Technical Debt Analysis (TechDebtDetector) → 
Report Formatting (ReportFormatter) → Output (Console/Markdown/JSON) → 
Prompt (Writer) → AI CLI (Invoker) → README_AI.md (Writer)
```

### Smart Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Two-Phase Processing | Phase 1: SmartWriter parallel generation; Phase 2: AI enhancement with rate limiting |
| AI Enhancement Strategies | Selective (overview + oversize) or all directories with `--ai-all` |
| Incremental Updates | Git change analysis via `incremental.py` |
| Parallel Processing | Batch processing with worker pools; error results include file_lines=0 |
| Hierarchical Levels | Smart content generation based on directory depth |
| Framework Detection | Pattern recognition for PHP/ThinkPHP projects |
| Symbol Importance Scoring | Multi-dimensional scoring combining visibility (0-20pts), semantic importance (5-25pts), documentation quality (0-15pts), code complexity (5-20pts), and naming pattern analysis (-20-0pts). Theoretical range -10 to 100, clamped to 0-100. |
| Adaptive Symbol Extraction | Three-step algorithm: (1) determine file size category based on line count from `ParseResult.file_lines`, (2) get configured symbol limit for category, (3) apply constraints (min/max bounds, total available symbols). Dynamically adjusts symbol display count across 7 categories (tiny/small/medium/large/xlarge/huge/mega) with intelligent constraint resolution. |
| Configuration Merging | User-provided adaptive config merged with defaults, preserving backward compatibility |
| Truncation Message Accuracy | Truncation notice correctly compares shown symbols against filtered symbol count (after filtering), not raw symbol count |
| Technical Debt Detection | Automated detection of file size issues (>2000 lines: HIGH, >5000 lines: CRITICAL), God Class anti-pattern (>50 methods: CRITICAL), symbol overload analysis (method counting, overloaded symbol detection), and code quality scoring (0-100 scale with severity-based deductions: CRITICAL -30pts, HIGH -15pts, MEDIUM -5pts, LOW -2pts) |
| Multi-File Aggregation | `TechDebtReporter` collects file-level results and generates aggregate statistics (total files, total issues, severity breakdown, average quality score) |
| Multi-Format Output | Three formatter implementations: `ConsoleFormatter` with ANSI color codes for terminal display, `MarkdownFormatter` with severity-grouped tables for documentation, `JSONFormatter` with complete data structure for programmatic consumption |
| Recursive Debt Analysis | `tech-debt` command supports `--recursive` flag to scan subdirectories and analyze all Python files in directory tree |
| Modular Command Structure | Technical debt command refactored into focused helper functions for file discovery, analysis pipeline, and output formatting; improves testability and maintainability |
| Code Quality Standards | All CLI output messages comply with E501 line length limits (≤88 characters); long strings split across multiple lines for improved readability and linting compliance |

## Provides

| Export | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| CLI Commands | `codeindex scan`, `scan-all`, `status`, `symbols`, `tech-debt` |
| README Generation | Automated documentation for code directories |
| Symbol Indexing | Global symbol cross-reference (`PROJECT_SYMBOLS.md`) |
| Incremental Updates | Smart regeneration based on changes |
| AI Enhancement | Configurable AI enhancement with rate limiting |
| File Line Tracking | `ParseResult.file_lines` provides accurate line count for each parsed file, enabling adaptive symbol selection |
| Symbol Scoring | Integrated multi-dimensional importance scoring: **Visibility** (public/protected/private patterns, language-specific rules: 0-20pts); **Semantic Analysis** (critical operations like create/update/delete/pay: 25pts, query operations like find/search: 15pts, generic methods: 5pts); **Documentation Quality** (comprehensive >200 chars: 15pts, medium >50 chars: 10pts, brief: 5pts, none: 0pts); **Code Complexity** (very large >100 lines: 20pts, large 50-100 lines: 15pts, medium 20-50 lines: 10pts, small <20 lines: 5pts); **Naming Pattern Penalties** (magic methods `__*`: -20pts, private methods `_*`: -15pts, getter/setter/checker patterns `get*/set*/is*/has*`: -10pts) |
| Adaptive Symbol Selection | `SmartWriter` integrates `AdaptiveSymbolSelector` to dynamically calculate per-file symbol limits. When `adaptive_symbols.enabled=True`, calls `calculate_limit(file_lines, total_symbols)` using actual file line counts; otherwise falls back to static `max_per_file`. Categories: tiny (<100 lines/10 symbols), small (<200/15), medium (<500/30), large (<1000/50), xlarge (<2000/80), huge (<5000/120), mega (≥5000/150). Constraints: min 5 symbols, max 200 symbols, capped by total available symbols. Truncation message uses filtered symbol count for accurate remaining symbol calculation. |
| Configuration Validation | `IndexingConfig.from_dict()` validates and merges user YAML with `DEFAULT_ADAPTIVE_CONFIG`, ensuring type safety and completeness |
| Technical Debt Analysis | `TechDebtDetector.analyze_file()` evaluates code quality and returns `DebtAnalysisResult` with detected issues, quality score (0-100), and actionable suggestions. `analyze_symbol_overload()` provides detailed symbol count analysis, overloaded symbol detection, and God Class identification. Detects: super large files (>5000 lines CRITICAL), large files (>2000 lines HIGH), God Classes (>50 methods CRITICAL with split recommendations), and symbol overload issues (massive symbol count >100 symbols HIGH, high noise ratio >50% low-quality symbols MEDIUM) |
| Technical Debt Reporting | `TechDebtReporter` provides multi-file aggregation with `add_file_result()` to collect individual `FileReport` instances and `generate_report()` to produce `TechDebtReport` with aggregate statistics: total files analyzed, total issues count, severity breakdown (critical/high/medium/low), and average quality score across all files |
| Report Formatting | Abstract `ReportFormatter` interface with three implementations: (1) `ConsoleFormatter` generates ANSI-colored output with severity highlighting (RED/YELLOW), summary statistics, and issue breakdown; (2) `MarkdownFormatter` generates documentation with summary section, severity-grouped tables (File/Category/Description/Suggestion columns), and hierarchical organization; (3) `JSONFormatter` generates machine-readable output with complete report data, file reports array, issues list, and metrics preservation |
| Technical Debt CLI | `tech-debt` command provides standalone technical debt analysis with options: `--format` (console/markdown/json), `--output` (file path), `--recursive` (scan subdirectories), `--quiet` (minimal output). Refactored into modular helper functions: `_find_python_files()` for file discovery, `_analyze_files()` for parsing and detection pipeline, `_format_and_output()` for report generation. Handles empty file lists gracefully with empty report generation. |
| Linting Compliance | All console output messages formatted to comply with E501 line length rules; status messages, AI enhancement logs, and symbol indexing output split into sub-88 character segments for improved code quality and maintainability |
