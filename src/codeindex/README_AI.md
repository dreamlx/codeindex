# README_AI.md - codeindex

## Purpose
AI-native code indexing tool that automatically generates README_AI.md files for directories using external LLM CLI tools.

## Architecture
The tool follows a pipeline architecture where directories are scanned, parsed, formatted into prompts, and sent to external AI CLI tools for documentation generation. It supports incremental updates, parallel processing, hierarchical organization with two-phase AI enhancement, and intelligent symbol scoring for prioritization.

Data Flow:
```
Directory (Scanner) → Files (Scanner) → Parsed Data (Parser) → 
Symbol Scoring (SymbolImportanceScorer) → Prompt (Writer) → 
AI CLI (Invoker) → README_AI.md (Writer)
```

## Key Components

### Core Classes

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `Config` | Central configuration loader handling `.codeindex.yaml` settings |
| `Scanner` | Directory traversal and file filtering based on include/exclude patterns |
| `Parser` | Multi-language AST parser extracting symbols, imports, and docstrings |
| `Writer` | Formats parsed data into markdown README files |
| `AIEnhancementConfig` | Controls AI enhancement strategy and rate limiting |
| `SymbolImportanceScorer` | Scores symbols by importance (0-100) for prioritized documentation using multi-dimensional analysis |
| `ScoringContext` | Framework and file type context for intelligent scoring |

### Command Pipeline

| Function | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `scan` | `codeindex scan <path>` | Scan single directory and generate README |
| `scan-all` | `codeindex scan-all [--ai-all]` | Process all directories with two-phase strategy |
| `status` | `codeindex status` | Show indexing coverage and statistics |

### Smart Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Two-Phase Processing | Phase 1: SmartWriter parallel generation; Phase 2: AI enhancement with rate limiting |
| AI Enhancement Strategies | Selective (overview + oversize) or all directories with `--ai-all` |
| Incremental Updates | Git change analysis via `incremental.py` |
| Parallel Processing | Batch processing with worker pools |
| Hierarchical Levels | Smart content generation based on directory depth |
| Framework Detection | Pattern recognition for PHP/ThinkPHP projects |
| Symbol Importance Scoring | Multi-dimensional scoring combining visibility (0-20pts), semantic importance (5-25pts), documentation quality (0-15pts), code complexity (5-20pts), and naming pattern analysis (-20-0pts). Theoretical range -10 to 100, clamped to 0-100. |

## Consumes

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| tree_sitter | Multi-language AST parsing |
| click | CLI interface and command handling |
| yaml | Configuration file parsing |
| rich | Terminal output formatting |
| git | Version control integration for incremental updates |

## Provides

| Export | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| CLI Commands | `codeindex scan`, `scan-all`, `status`, `symbols` |
| README Generation | Automated documentation for code directories |
| Symbol Indexing | Global symbol cross-reference (`PROJECT_SYMBOLS.md`) |
| Incremental Updates | Smart regeneration based on changes |
| AI Enhancement | Configurable AI enhancement with rate limiting |
| Symbol Scoring | Integrated multi-dimensional importance scoring: **Visibility** (public/protected/private patterns, language-specific rules: 0-20pts); **Semantic Analysis** (critical operations like create/update/delete/pay: 25pts, query operations like find/search: 15pts, generic methods: 5pts); **Documentation Quality** (comprehensive >200 chars: 15pts, medium >50 chars: 10pts, brief: 5pts, none: 0pts); **Code Complexity** (very large >100 lines: 20pts, large 50-100 lines: 15pts, medium 20-50 lines: 10pts, small <20 lines: 5pts); **Naming Pattern Penalties** (magic methods `__*`: -20pts, private methods `_*`: -15pts, getter/setter/checker patterns `get*/set*/is*/has*`: -10pts) |
