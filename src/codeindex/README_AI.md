# README_AI.md - codeindex

## Purpose
AI-native code indexing tool that automatically generates README_AI.md files for directories using external LLM CLI tools. Includes technical debt detection capabilities for code quality analysis with multiple output formats and intelligent AI enhancement strategies for super large files.

## Architecture
The tool follows a pipeline architecture where directories are scanned, parsed, formatted into prompts, and sent to external AI CLI tools for documentation generation. It supports incremental updates, parallel processing, hierarchical organization with two-phase AI enhancement, intelligent symbol scoring for prioritization, adaptive symbol extraction with dynamic limit calculation, technical debt detection with flexible output formatting for code quality assessment, and adaptive AI enhancement strategies for handling super large files with multi-turn dialogue.

Data Flow:
```
Directory (Scanner) → Files (Scanner) → Parsed Data (Parser) → 
Symbol Scoring (SymbolImportanceScorer) → Adaptive Symbol Selection (AdaptiveSymbolSelector) → 
Technical Debt Analysis (TechDebtDetector) → 
Report Formatting (ReportFormatter) → Output (Console/Markdown/JSON) → 
Super Large File Detection (AIEnhancement) → Strategy Selection → 
Multi-Turn Dialogue (if super large) OR Standard Prompt → 
Prompt (Writer) → AI CLI (Invoker) → README_AI.md (Writer)
```

### Smart Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Two-Phase Processing | Phase 1: SmartWriter parallel generation; Phase 2: AI enhancement with rate limiting |
| AI Enhancement Strategies | Selective (overview + oversize) or all directories with `--ai-all` |
| Incremental Updates | Git change analysis via `incremental.py` |
| Parallel Processing | Batch processing with worker pools; error results include file_lines=0 |
| Hierarchical Levels | Smart content generation based on directory depth |
| Framework Detection | Pattern recognition for PHP/ThinkPHP projects |
| Symbol Importance Scoring | Multi-dimensional scoring combining visibility (0-20pts), semantic importance (5-25pts), documentation quality (0-15pts), code complexity (5-20pts), and naming pattern analysis (-20-0pts). Theoretical range -10 to 100, clamped to 0-100. |
| Adaptive Symbol Extraction | Three-step algorithm: (1) determine file size category based on line count from `ParseResult.file_lines`, (2) get configured symbol limit for category, (3) apply constraints (min/max bounds, total available symbols). Dynamically adjusts symbol display count across 7 categories (tiny/small/medium/large/xlarge/huge/mega) with intelligent constraint resolution. |
| Configuration Merging | User-provided adaptive config merged with defaults, preserving backward compatibility |
| Truncation Message Accuracy | Truncation notice correctly compares shown symbols against filtered symbol count (after filtering), not raw symbol count |
